# brain-anaysis-logs
logs from the brain analysis of the interpreter, in 1995 ghost in the shell.

Explanation :
10 minutes after the beggining of the movie, there is a scene in which we can see logs.
These logs come from the real-time brain analysis performed on the interpreter of the minister.
I wrote them in a text file using the magic "frame-by-frame" button, searching for easter eggs.

Mistakes :
"POSTERIORES" is once spelled "POSTERIRES", and "START" is moslty spelled "STRAT"

Easter-eggs :
"M. YGODDDESS" (my goddess) is probably a reference to "Oh! My Goddess!" (an old manga)
and "M. ATSUMO TOKAORU" (matsumoto kaoru) but I don't know what this one means
