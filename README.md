# brain-anaysis-logs
logs from the brain analysis of the interpreter, in 1995 ghost in the shell movie.

Explanation :
10 minutes after the beggining of the film, there is a scene in which we can see logs.
These logs come from the real-time brain analysis performed on the interpreter of the minister.

I used the "frame-by-frame" button in vlc to write these lines in a real text file.
However some were cropped, so I had to guess several letters using the other lines.

Obvious mistakes :
"POSTERIORES" is once spelled "POSTERIRES"
"START" is moslty spelled "STRAT"

Easter-eggs :
"M. YGODDDESS" (my goddess) probably refers to "Oh! My Goddess!" (an old manga)
"M. ATSUMO TOKAORU" (matsumoto kaoru) This one is tough...
